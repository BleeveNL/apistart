# ApiStart

## Overview

ApiStart is a framework that is build to minimalize the time to market for Back-end systems. The goal is to generate a
 strictly typed NodeJS framework that implements the best practices code patterns and connects easy and in a structured
 way with other common IT systems like Databases, Caching systems, message queues etc. This all to help the developer
 to archieve faster his/her goals to shorten the time to market as much as possible.

## Current state

However we're using this framework already internaly. This framework isn't ready for production yet. We're currently in
 the development stage. So please don't use this framework in production environments. We're trying to bring this
  framework as soon as possible to a stable version. Please stay tuned until then.
